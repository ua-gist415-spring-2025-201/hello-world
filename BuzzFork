##### I am Shaden, I am from the best state in the Union, Colorado.
I am Walter.  I am a land surveyor, and a 3D-Animator and quickly becoming a GIS Analyst.  After completing my capstone project I am excited to find more ways to use GIS to make Land Development smarter and better moving into the future. There is so much data to be gathered and synced and updated to provide the best information available for good decision in a myriad of fields. With so many uses on which to base high stakes decisions, then having independent/open source verification of any analysis is a smart move, and could also lead to developing more specific and powerful tools. When do we get to doing some work?
